# Complex Modelling Workshop: Activated Assemblies

For this workshop, we will investigate the use of computer simulation to mimic the physical behaviour of material systems.

This investigation will be based on the use of the *dynamic relaxation* (DR) method, which consist in finding the equilibrium state of an abstract physical model representing the material system.

For this we provide a DR engine which runs inside rhino/grasshopper. Please follow the installation instructions below.

## Installation

1. make sure you have the latest software versions: Rhino 5 up-to-date and grasshopper > 0.9.61 
2. download the ghpython component from [http://www.food4rhino.com/project/ghpython]. You need to log in *and* follow the instructions.
2. download the hoopsnake component from [http://www.food4rhino.com/project/hoopsnake]. You need to log in *and* follow the instructions.
3. restart rhino/grasshopper
3. open the example_00_DynamicRelaxation.3dm in rhino and DynamicRelaxation.gh in grasshopper
4. toggle reset to true, then back to false
5. toggle run to true and see if things are moving
